# COFE EOL JAVA

Java code using the HAPI-FHIR (1.4) library created for the HL7 Baltimore WGM 201609 Connectathon CCDA on FHIR track to test the exchange of DSTU 2 Clinical Documents (using document Bundle resources containing a Composition and other supporting resources) that conform to the profiles of 
the in-progress C-CDA on FHIR Implementation Guide.

These java examples make use of the opensource JAVA FHIR API located here https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/

The example java code demonstrates how the FHIR XML content within the CDA On FHIR England - End of Life Care Document DMS can be created. For further details see [NHSConnect cda-to-fhir-eol repo](https://github.com/nhsconnect/cda-to-fhir-eol).

The 201609 Connectathon [CCDA on FHIR ](http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=201609_C-CDA_on_FHIR) track should be read in tandem with the examples in this repo.
